I am reading wait but why blog poasts and I know that is exactly the way I would love to write and share kbowledge. I lwarn stuff nd then transmit said stuff into he brainsof others in an entertaining yet useful lway. Th eonly problem is , I do not kno whwat I want to learn and it is so frustrationg

<br>
I am a qunitessisal modern child. Modern life is so seasy that even the tiniest bit of challeneg ethrows me off completely. Now as I write this, I do not "fell" like writing.It feels like SUCH a chore and I wanna give up an dbinge watch self improvement videos soI can be lazy but superiorly lazy adn say "Hey, at least I am not rottin my brain cells doomscrolling on TikTok". It is all the same. WHo am I kidding 

<br>
Let me plan out all the things I have to change

I have to learn to:
1. Deal with the uncomfy feeling of "Ugh I do not wanna do this" and then do it anyways
2. Be able to come up with new ideas because I do not allow myself to be bored enpugh to generate fresh thoughts
3. Learn more stuff

Okay these things sound very vague and not at all concretet but at least it is a start. I shall refine as I go. 

Let me note down my obstacles
1. Time  ie Snapchat stories, YT shorts, Pinterest, etc.
2. Fatigue caused by said time thiefs stealing my sleeping time. And poor eating habits. And inadequate phsyical exercise
3. Brain laziness and lack of desire to think through problems on my own thanks to the vailablility of AI that can do my problem solving for me. Most times,  not all the time.

Another reason is on days when we do not feel very confident in ourselves, a look at the things we have accomplished does wonders for our self-esteem. We are reminded of the things we are capable of when we set our mind to it, and this prevents us from falling into the dreaded 'rut'.
These are a few reasons why I think projects are crucial to our development and hence a fulfilling existence because what is life without self-improvement??
